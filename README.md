## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Example

```tsx
import DataTable from "./components/DataTable/DataTable";
import type { Column } from "./components/DataTable/DataTable.types";

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const columns: Column<User>[] = [
  { key: "name", title: "Name", dataIndex: "name", sortable: true },
  { key: "email", title: "Email", dataIndex: "email", sortable: true },
];

const data: User[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" },
  { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", email: "jane@example.com" },
];

<DataTable<User>
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  selectable
  loading={false}
  onRowSelect={(selected) => console.log(selected)}

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Design Decisions

- **TypeScript Generics:** Used for strong typing and reusability across data shapes.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, consistent, and modern UI styling.
- **Accessibility:** Added ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus states.
- **Sorting & Selection:** Managed with React state and memoization for performance.
- **Storybook:** Used for isolated development, documentation, and visual testing.
- **Testing:** Used Vitest and React Testing Library to cover all states and interactions.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs & Known Limitations

- **Sorting:** Only supports simple value comparison (no custom sort functions yet).
- **Selection:** Uses reference equality; for complex data, a unique key is recommended.
- **Styling:** Tailwind is used for speed, but can be customized further for branding.
- **Accessibility:** Basic ARIA and keyboard support; more advanced features can be added.

---

## üß™ Testing

- All states (loading, empty, selection, sorting) are covered.
- Example test for row selection and loading state.
- **Test file:**  
  See [`src/components/DataTable/DataTable.test.tsx`](src/components/DataTable/DataTable.test.tsx) for details.
- To run tests:
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```

---

## üìö Storybook

- Stories for default, loading, empty, selectable, and sorted states.
- Controls to play with props interactively.
- Docs panel includes usage and prop descriptions.

---

## üì± Accessibility & Responsiveness

- Table is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
- ARIA roles and labels are used for screen readers.
- Keyboard navigation is supported for row selection.

---

## üé® Styling

- Tailwind classes for a clean, modern look.
- Subtle hover and focus states for interactivity.
- Rounded corners and shadow for visual polish.

## üí° Personal Touch

I enjoyed building this component, especially focusing on accessibility and clean code. I learned a lot about React generics and Storybook workflows.  
If I had more time, I would add custom sort functions and more advanced keyboard navigation.
